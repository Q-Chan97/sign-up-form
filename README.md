This project was a fun way to put together flexbox, form layouts, and validation in CSS. 

One of the big gotchas I had with this was at the very end, I remembered that I needed to have the submit button for the for actually BE in the form otherwise it wouldn't work properly. Took some googling then I realized that the form element is just like any other, and can have other divs inside of it. Made the rest of the work a lot for straightforward.

I feel like I had some unnecessary/redundant styling in my CSS page, especially after having to go back and fix the form element. It's something I'm gonna have to take slower in my next project.

Up next is Grid layout! Looking forward to learning how I can mix Flex and Grid in my projects.
